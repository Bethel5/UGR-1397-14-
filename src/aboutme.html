        <p>Hello, my name is Bethel Dereje. I am web designer and developerÂ driven by my passion for coding, problem-solving, and coming up with creative solutions fuels my intense curiosity.  I am thrilled to explore the constantly changing world of technology. I have a strong interest in software development, and I'm always learning new programming languages and design concepts to be able to make a valuable contribution. My hobbies include baking, photography and listening to music.</p>
